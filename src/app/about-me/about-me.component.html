                MY JOURNEY BEGAN <br>
                <br>
                During the lockdown I often visited bookstores. I've spent a lot of time in IT.
                So I quickly bought my first book "Learning to program from head to toe".
                Then I decided to use my free time to gain experience in programming, both alone and in a team.

                MY INTEREST <br>
                <br>
                I like working with the Angular framework and the accompanying Angular Material & Material Design, because it gives me a
                good overview of the code.
                The easier code is to understand, the better it is for everyone.

                <br>
                a team that supports each other and can grow beyond themselves.
                In my opinion, this also has a major impact on product quality.
