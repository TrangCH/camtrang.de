                MY JOURNEY BEGAN <br>
                <br>
                During the beginning of the the lockdown I started reading IT books as 
                I was always interested in It. My first book was "Learning to program from head to toe". 
                After finding out that IT was most interesting for me, I decided to use my free time 
                to gain experience in programming, both alone and in teams with other developers.

                MY INTEREST <br>
                <br>
                I like working with the Angular framework and the accompanying Angular Material & Material
                 Design, because it gives me a good overview of the code. I'm also open to working with 
                 other frameworks and technologies. <br>
                <br>
                The easier code is to understand, the better it is for everyone.
